# Faster K-Medoids Clustering Algorithms


## Description

This package provides R wrappers of C++ implemenation of Faster K-Medoids clustering algorithms (FastPAM, FastCLARA and FastCLARANS) proposed in Erich Schubert and Peter J. Rousseeuw 2019.

## Examples
```R
    # We use the demo data sets "USArrests"
    data("USArrests")
    df <- scale(USArrests)
    dv <- as.vector(dist(df)) # compute distance matrix (lower triangular part)
    n <- nrow(df)
    
    # PAM
    clusters <- pam(dv, n, k=3)
    clusters
    
    # FastPAM (use "LAB" initializer by default)
    clusters1 <- fastpam(dv, n, k=3)
    clusters1
    
    # FastPAM, specify "BUILD" as initializer
    clusters2 <- fastpam(dv, n, k=3, initializer="BUILD")
    clusters2
    
    # FastCLARA
    clusters3 <- fastclara(dv, n, k=3, numsamples = 5, sampling=0.25)
    clusters3
    
    # FastCLARANS
    clusters4 <- fastclarans(dv, n, k=3, numlocal=2, maxneighbor=0.025)
    clusters4
  
```


## Details

The C++ Faster K-Medoids clustering algorithms (FastPAM, FastCLARA and FastCLARANS) are ported from ELKI project (see http://elki-project.github.io/). To generate identical results, the random number generator, specifically xorshift+ generators, is also ported. The results between this fastkmedoids R package will be the same with ELKI if using same seed for random number generator.

Besides FastPAM, FastCLARA and FastCLARANS, this R wrapper also provide However, in the C++ code, the classic algorithms, including PAM, CLARA and CLARANS, are also implemented. If interested in writing wrappers for these algorithms, please use the github repository: https://github.com/lixun910/fastkmedoids

All three algorithms take the distance matrix (lower triangular part, column wise storage) as input, which can be computed using dist() function in R (see the examples below). If using a pre-computed distance matrix, please transform it (lower triangular part, column wise storage) to a 1-dimensional array.

All three algorithms takes the same parameters as in ELKI. If the explanation of the input paramters is not clear, please refer to ELKI :

* FastCLARANS: https://elki-project.github.io/releases/current/javadoc/de/lmu/ifi/dbs/elki/algorithm/clustering/kmeans/FastCLARANS.html

The C++ code is a part of GeoDa (https://github.com/geodacenter/geoda) and libgeoda. If you are interested in a GUI version of this C++ implementation. You can download and use the free and cross-platform GeoDa software from https://geodacenter.github.io.
